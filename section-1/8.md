## Example of Functional Documentation - Physical

Notes:
- You must pay attention about the user (the user that use your solution or products can be has different languages), thats why you should considered to include some visual thing to your documentation
- Some other alternatives is using translation, but it will cost your budget. So that's why by adding visual instructional it can be help you to push the budget to translate your documentation.
- Consider the User Experience approach so we can stay focus about the software development rather than tehnical documentation. Make your software intuitive enough, so your products/software doesn't need a documentation on how to use it.
