## What is the Result from Technical Writing

### Documentation Deliverables
Commonly recognized deliverables, results from the works of the technical writer are:
- User Guide (a manual/ where is the manual)
- Quick Start Guide (how do I quickly and easily using your product)
- Checklist (setup steps a thing, to using properly the product)
- Instructional Video, etc.

## My Thoughts (Key Points)
