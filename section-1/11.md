## Strategy for Writing Task-Oriented Documentation

1. Idenfity the tasks that the customer needs to perform. (high level task from the user, should be particular process from user that can solve their problems)
2. Sequence them in sa logical order. (Step by step to used our products (example. If we provide email organization, the first one step is about to create and account and then next step is iteration on organize email, etc), logical order is important, we, as the provider should know on how user will use our products or solutions, which the step that user will do first or the second one)
3. Add supporting concepts and information that the customer needs to know. (Knowledge Gaps between your overal architecture from your products and the user who use it)
4. Add supporting reference information that helps them later on, once they know the products better. (how to perform shorten task, how to setup my account - First setup, how to setup the admin user of email account - More than one setup)
