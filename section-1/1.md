### Technical Writer
A technical writer is a **professional information communicator** whose task is to transfer information between two or more parties, through any medium that best facilitates the transfer and comprehension of the information.
Technical writers research and create information through a variety of delivery media (electronic, printed, audio-visual and even touch)

##  My Thoughts (Key points)
- Technical writer has more spesifically jobs is to deliver information about the software/products/solutions to the end user, so the user can know how to use it properly and knowing how easy the solutions to implement on their own case or problems by writing some text that can make the end user enjoy to use our solutions/products/software. 
- The scope of technical documentation more wider or much more isn't simple than technical writer becasuse the scope of the technical documentation isn't limited only about writing a text. We can also documenting our solutions/products by using video tutorials, or even some instructional infographics, and also we must don't forget to do a research(know the product, know the services that we describe, know how it suppose to work, know how it's been build) about the products that we will be documented.
