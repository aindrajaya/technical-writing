## Why Writing in GitHub

[GitHub](https://github.com) offers both plans for private and free repositories on the same account which are commonly used to host open source software projects. And GitHub has huge opportunity as a backend for us to store our content and code when we work on Software Development.
When we build our software development projects, we usually working as a team. And one particular goal is about to deliver high-quality software to the user. And the software documentation that the technical writers develop is an integral part of the software product. In many cases if our software development without software documentation, we don't really have a software product, because it's useless and user don't know how to use. That's why, we always must provide some instruction to the user how to use our products/ software/ solutions.
The technical Writer in the team is so important, you contribute to the overall user experience with the software and you need to help the users to use it in the right way. This directly impacts how well the users will use this software after they have purchased that.
