## Function Documentation

Function type of documentation
- Suitable for just getting started with a new Product
- Explains what you see infront you
- Helps you find your way through the product
- Often used for physical products

## My Thoughts (Key points)
- it has different interpretation from the physical function documentation and the software function documentation. On the **physical documentation** just need to explian on how to use it, where to running the product, which button should I push, and etc. For the **Software documentation** is different, we need to write about how to getting started with this solution.
